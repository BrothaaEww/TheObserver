 "The Observer" is an advanced security system designed for robust human target detection and acquisition in sensitive areas like server rooms. Deployed using CCTV technology, the system utilizes Python 3 with YOLOv5 for real-time object detection, dlib, face-recognition modules for facial recognition, and VGG19 for action detection. It features a graphical user interface developed with tkinter, enabling comprehensive monitoring of individuals, detection of unauthorized access, and alerting for unethical behavior. This integrated approach ensures proactive security through precise detection and immediate response capabilities.
